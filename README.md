The goal of AntiAd is to help you maintain a server where people don't advertise, spam or write in all caps.  
When a player is sending advertisement or spam in the chat it shows a message to the people with the permission `antiad.see` the advertised/spammy message - The advertising/spammy player gets a warning and a message that spam/advertisement isn't allowed (the message can be changed in the config).  
We are doing this by giving everyone n (default 3) chances (resets with a server restart), when they used their 3 chances there a executed a command (the command can be set in the config).  

**but Isn't my own website blocked then?**  
 By default everything is blocked, you can however add items to the whitelist with the command `antiad add` website, it is there possible to use * to allow more items.
Let's say you have a forum on forum.website.com and you want everything on the forum to be whitelisted, then you run the command `antiad add forum.website.com/*` then everything is allowed on that website (where the links begins with forum.website.com).

**We have 2 different webpatterns:**  
* **Strict**: Blocks every TLD, it also sometimes blocks something there are shown not to be a domain
* **Simple**: Blocks 50 of the most common TLDs It can be activated by chainging `useSimpleWebPattern` to true in the config.
